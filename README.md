# ReactVS.Svelte

Comparing React and Svelte

# Svelte/SvelteKit Vs React/NextJs

# Performance

Reactjs enhances the performance as it allows building with reusable components. Thus, with reduced code clutter it is easier to gain consistency in the app development cycle. Moreover, it platform employs optimized coding practices that enhances the user experience along with app’s performance.
Svelte minimizes the runtime overload which leads to faster interface navigation. It also offers flexibility so that the developers could produce high-quality codes. Plus you don’t have to worry about the complexities that surround Virtual DOM overhead. Also, apps developed through Svelte are powerful and sophisticated.

# User experience

For user experience comparison of React Vs Svelte; React is an ultra-fast application and it boosts the loading speed. As the web pages load fast, it increases the user experience. With an increased user experience.
Svelte supports component-based UI design and thus is exceptional in building lightweight apps. The page speed also increases as Svelte removes the middle-stage loading of virtual DOM. With enhanced user experience, the platform also increases the response time.

# Code maintainability

React is a component based architecture. As the codes can be used elsewhere, this app breakdown enhances the team’s productivity and efficiency. The React platform itself has such organized coding patterns and components that makes the code easy to learn.
Svelte have a readable structure that helps in defining different app components. So along with acting in performance comparison, the platform helps the developers to maintain the code as well. With Svelte, different pieces of a web application like buttons, forms, etc. work together easily

# App size

Reactjs is a fully featured frontend framework. Thus, it is easier to build bigger and more complex applications using React.
Svelte is widely used in creating small-sized applications. Thus, it is the most accessible JavaScript component library and it runs the development process in a better way

# Faster development

React has a reputation of being the fastest framework. Thus in the race of React Vs Svelte, React has some edge. All you need is a team of developers who are familiar with the basic JavaScript concepts. Once you know this along with configuration caveats, etc. the speed of development increases.
Svelte, the developers can develop more advanced features easily. In addition, they can separate the app structure and the design HTML markup. Also , with the clear separation of front-end control and functioning, it is easier for the developers to have faster development.

# Testing

Reactjs offers test runners. Thus, it helps the QA team to find the problem in real browser settings. In addition, this reduces the time-to-market of the app, increasing the overall app productivity.
The developers can conduct unit testing with the Svelte testing library. The library is smaller in size and has less complex computations.
